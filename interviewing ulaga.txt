1. Welcome (Set the Stage) 

"Thank you very much for giving some of your time to answer our questionnaires."

We are the group of LookBahay and we are trying to make and develop a website 
that offers an easy and convenient way to get a boarding house or apartment 
in Lucban, Quezon. 

Looking for a decent and reliable place to live is hard nowadays, one of the reason is
the impact of the pandemic most of the boarding houses in lucban were closed.
Even each of the members of our group get struggles on looking for a boarding house, but hopefully 
with the help of our colleauges we've able get to one. That's where we get our idea, what if we build a website
with the lists all the available boarding houses/apartments in lucban quezon.

Do you think the website can solve the problem of the boarding house/apartment seekers? 

What do you think about the other products(utensils, colgate and other things that the boarders might need),
should we remove it or no?
